# About the Wiki
- 👋 Welcome to @Transgender-Resource-Wiki
- 🏳️‍⚧️ The goal of this wiki is to collect resources for transgender people
- ⚧️ and to put it all in one organized space!
- 📫 Contact: transgenderwiki@protonmail.com
- 😴 I'm not sure how often I'll be able to get around to checking it though...
- 💻 One day in the future this wiki may have it's own domain instead of being on github
  
# About the Developer
- 👱‍♀️ Hi, I'm a trans woman and I run this wiki by myself currently
- ✏️ I'm also a college student, which means my code might suck but oh well
